# Pick-Pack-improvement-analystics (Python)
This is a innovation data analytics project I did when I work for Jafra Cosmetics from Dec,2018 to May,2019

What's the situation before analystics?

The working load for each picker was not equal, and during the busy hour, we can see some idle pickers while some pickers are super busy.

The output was 150 orders/h.

What I did?

•	The datasets including 20 variables and 300,000 rows.

•	Extracted useful columns and rows from large scales of datasets and cleaned data using Python Pandas library.

•	Applied concat function to combine different datasets and group by products picked for each station.

•	Randomly shuffled the products’ location for 100,000 times to find the optimal solution.

•	Developed a user friendly GUI to help internal non-technical users to operate the datasets.

What's the improvmeent?

After implement the analytics, the pick pack effiency was improved from 150 orders/h to 260 orders/h.
